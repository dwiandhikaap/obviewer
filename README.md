# obviewer - Beatmap viewer for osu! standard
- Web based application to view an osu! standard beatmap

\
This code was migrated from an old repository of mine called `replaytale-core` which is an osu! Replay Utility where you can watch, analyze, or even edit your replay.
\
\
However, since it requires an implementation for the gameplay mechanics/osu! rulesets _(which is honesty really painful to imitate)_, 
it really took a long time to get it right. Since i also don't have a lot of free time, i don't really want to continue it.
\
\
Fast forward 2 months later, i decided to finish it but as a beatmap viewer, since it's a lot simpler\
~~*also i need something to fill my portofolio*~~ :trollface:
